TODOs on ChromeOS Debian:
- Make a new VM to test
- Add customizations
  - Enable [Debian Backports](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/): ```deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main```
- Make sure the following work cleanly:
  - Packages
    - Brew
    - Conda
    - Flatpak (add backports version!)
    - Kitty
    - Neovim
    - NVM
    - VLC
    - VSCode
   
# Non-starters
- Chromebrew: Requires developer mode, which just isn't worth it
